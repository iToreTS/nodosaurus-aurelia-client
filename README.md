# nodosaurus-aurelia-client

## Why?
I wanted to learn more about Hapi and needed a frontend. Aurelia is new. So, Aurelia.  
Please note that this is super beta! Aurelia is not in beta yet + I am new to Aurelia so use at your own risk...

## What's inside

* JWT authentication
* Aurelia Auth plugin
* Uses Bootstrap for some basic styling.
* Stripe checkout for payments.


## Coming soon

 * Tests. I had an issue getting gulp to work. It works now so adding tests.
 * Better Client config file for stripe. Currently hardcoded key when accepting payments. You will need to change to use your key.
 * Bug fixes and things I missed.
 * Your pull request to fix issues, styles, etc.

## Getting started

* Clone/Fork the repo
* Have Node installed
* npm i the project structure
* gulp watch


## Credits
* MEAN.JS project as this is a port of that code.
* Frame - User API written in Hapi
* Hapi-Boilerplate (Basic structure of this project)
* Hapi website. Docs are rock solid on that site.
